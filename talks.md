## Frontent Monoliths: Run if you can!

The frontend monoliths are here! They arrived with the trend to build modern single page applications. Frameworks like Angular and React boosted the growht of these monoliths.

While we were carefully cultivating micro-services in the backend, a new generation of monoliths conquered the frontend. Nobody saw them coming, but they are here now and we don't know how to get rid of them.

Frontend monoliths are obese, slow and prevent any form of agility. It is difficult and expensive to change their behavior. A monolith is tightly coupled to underlying frameworks and libraries which prevents the adoption of new technologies. This is harmful, especially in the frontend ecosystem where technologies change at a unhealthy pace.

The talk shows how frontend monoliths are characterized and how they come into existence. The talk shows different approaches how to get rid of frontend monoliths, even though there is no "silver bullet" or single "best practice" yet. We will have a look at different forms of the mythical "Micro-Frontend".

As an example for an approach to "micro-frontends" we will have a demonstration of the SCION Workbench. The SCION Workbench Application Platform [1] is an open-source project based on Angular which allows to integrate content from multiple web applications in a coherent way, thus enabling a micro frontend architecture. Different features of an application can be realized with different frontend frameworks, independently deployed and autonomously operated. With the concept of an application manifest every application can declare its capabilities and intents to allow for loosely coupled inter-application navigation. Integration into the platform is as lean as possible, consequently, any web application can be integrated without the need for adaptation.

## Angular, React, Vue: Which one should I choose? Does it even matter?

In this talk we have a look at the most important characteristics of the current "big three" of frontend frameworks: Angular, React and Vue.
We will see that there are many similarities between the frameworks but there are significant differences too. Each framework has ist special flair, it's strengths and ist weaknesses.
The talk tries to give an objective overview, so that you can choose the framework that fits your team, your project and your preferences.
The talk will not tell you which is the best framework, since there is no "best" which fits everyone!
